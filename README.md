## Kubernetes Deployment Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project aims to deploy several applications on a Kubernetes cluster using YAML configurations. The applications included are EJBCA, One Time Secret, Plik, Wiki.js, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, an Nginx proxy is used to handle SSL termination and route traffic to the appropriate services. The SSL certificates are obtained from Let's Encrypt and the DNS domains are configured using CloudNS.
